# Large Language Model from scratch

This project is the implementation from scratch of a LLM, using the GPT transformer model. It was implemented with Python and PyTorch.
The model was trained on the Open Web Corpus [OpenWebCorpus](https://skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus/).

I gained an understanding of the following material:
 - GPT Decoders
 - Masked multi-head attention
 - Scaled dot-product attention (query, key, values)
 - Calculation of attention scores
 -  Embeddings, positional embeddings
 - Weight initialization (e.g. Xavier init)
 - Optimization techniques (Adam with weight decay)
 - Data extraction from large .xz files
